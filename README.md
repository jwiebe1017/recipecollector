# Recipe Parser
This simple script uses the terminal and user input to provide ingredients and instructions  
from an input url provided by the user on launch.  
The user is able to multiply the portion size of the ingredients.  

This only works if the site has and adheres to simple ld+json logic provided by google [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe)

## requirements
`requests`  
`bs4`  
`json`  
`fractions`
